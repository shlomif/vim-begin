<dt id="irc"><a href="irc/">IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</a></dt>

<dd>
Internet Relay Chat is probably the fastest way to receive answers to most
common beginner questions. Please visit <a href="irc/">the link</a> to
learn more about it, and see where it is best to ask, what to avoid doing and
what to expect.

<dt id="mailing-lists"><a href="mailing-lists/">Mailing Lists</a></dt>

<dd>
Mailing lists allow you to ask questions by E-mail and also learn from
similar discussions. They are the best solution for more obscure questions,
or if you're not short on time and want less interactive, but more in-depth
discussions.
</dd>

<dt id="web-forums"><a href="web-forums/">Web Forums</a></dt>

<dd>
Web forums are similar to mailing lists, but all interaction is done through
a web-browser, and one can use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">web feeds</a> to monitor them.
We have concentrated a selection of Vim-related web forums on
<a href="web-forums/">the Web Forums page</a>.
