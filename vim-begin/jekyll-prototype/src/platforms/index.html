<h1>Vim on Various Platforms</h1>

<h2 id="note">Note</h2>

<p>
Vim and its GUI interfaces such as GVim or MacVim are very portable and run
fine on Microsoft Windows, on Mac OS X, on Linux and other UNIX systems
such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and OpenSolaris, HP/UX and AIX,
and on many others more exotic (and nowadays less common) platforms.
</p>

<p>
This page will contain some operating system (or Linux distribution)-specific
notes.
